## About

**bottom-lounge-chatbot** is an OpenAI-powered chatbot configured for use on www.bottomlounge.com. It periodically scrapes information from the website for use in its responses.

---

## Client Installation

To install the chatbot on a website, add the following script and link tags to the bottom of the page's body, replacing `chatbotserver.tld` with the hostname of your chatbot server:
```html
    <!-- begin chatbot code -->
    <!-- use of defer makes script tag non-blocking -->
    <script
      defer
      src="https://chatbotserver.tld/assets/chatbot.js"
      type="module"
    ></script>
    <!-- media query hack to make css non-blocking -->
    <link
      rel="stylesheet"
      media="print"
      onload="this.onload=null;this.removeAttribute('media');"
      href="https://chatbotserver.tld/assets/chatbot.css"
    />
    <!-- end chatbot code -->
```
In order to work, the website's origin must be added to the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable on the chatbot server. The chatbot will not work on any website that is not listed in `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`.
